# Geron (Gestural Remote Control)

Develop a smart personal assistant which makes use of natural means of interaction – for example, gestural, (pseudo) haptic – in order to control certain home appliances such as BluRay players, fridges, kitchen robots, washing machines, TV sets, and others. For a proper interaction, propose a set of gestures to be used to control these (classes of) home appliances. The status of each controlled appliance can be viewed via a smart device (phone, tablet, TV) interface.
